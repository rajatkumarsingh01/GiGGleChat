- This is a feature-rich chat application developed in Kotlin with Firebase as the backend. The application includes real-time chat, status updates, call functionality, push notifications, and the ability to add reactions to messages.

## Features
**Real-time Chat**: Users can engage in real-time chat conversations with friends and contacts. Messages are instantly delivered and displayed in a user-friendly interface.
